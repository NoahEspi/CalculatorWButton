Python calculator with buttons

This program is a calculator I made in Tkinter for a school project.
All buttons perform the functions you would expect, however, the symbol on the screen may appear different.

You can also use the keyboard instead of clicking buttons if you'd like.
All buttons are the same on the keyboard as they appear on the screen except: sin is s, cos is c, tan in t, C/AC is Del, and 2nd is the space bar.

Have fun calculating!
